        <p class="story-text">I was born and raised in our beautiful province of Marinduque, the eldest, and the only boy among the six children of Mr. and Mrs. Miranda. Most of my early years were in the province, making most of my core influenced by provincial life.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="story-text">I grew up in a financially struggling family making me give my best in my studies as early as my elementary days.  This is so, due to the classic advice that if you are born poor and you don‚Äôt want to stay forever that way, education can be one of the keys.</p>

        <p class="story-text">The belief that education can, in the future, change the quality of my life plus my curiosity, interest in learning things, and scholarship requirement, push me to work hardest on my studies. This eventually makes me graduate as class valedictorian both in elementary and high school.</p>
